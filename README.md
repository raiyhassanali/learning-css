## 🔥 Purpose  

To build **solid mastery** of CSS through consistent hands-on practice and intentionally designed challenges — not just reading docs.  
Every file here represents deliberate practice to sharpen real front-end skills.

## 🚀 How I Practice  
- Break down concepts into small exercises  
- Rebuild UI components from scratch  
- Recreate real website sections  
- Experiment with animations and transitions  
- Focus on **clean, readable CSS** — not shortcuts

## 📈 Goals  
- Master CSS deeply, not superficially  
- Build intuition for layout and responsive design  
- Create production-ready UI components  
- Boost speed and accuracy for real projects  

## 🤝 Contributions  
This is a learning-focused repo, so external contributions are not open right now.  
However, suggestions, ideas, and UI challenge recommendations are always welcome.

## 📬 Contact
